The main goal of this project was to build a Tic Tac Toe game putting in practice the Object Oriented 
Programing (OOP) paradigm. It consist of an interface (bin/main.rb) and two classes (lib/dashboard.rb and lib/player.rb). For the interface I used [TTY prompt component](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt#31-symbols).

## Built With

- [TTY prompt component](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt#31-symbols)

## How to install the game?
